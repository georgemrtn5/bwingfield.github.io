I am a PhD student interested in [stratified medicine](http://biomed.science.ulster.ac.uk/stratifiedmed/-What-is-Stratified-Medicine-.html),  [biomarkers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker), the [intestinal microbiome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_microbiota#Intestinal_flora), and [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Machine_learning).

Hopefully I'll put interesting or useful things here.
