summary:    Weird blue backgrounds wih matplotlib and ipython notebooks

---

I spent an hour trying to figure this out, so I'm writing it down for posterity.

In one particular ipython notebook I was working on my matplotlib plots had no axis lines, a light blue background, and a grid. None of my other notebooks had it. I restarted the notebook,  rebuilt the graph from scratch, and it would still randomly break.

At an earlier point in my ipython notebook I was importing seaborn - a data visualisation library. Seaborn overwrites the matplotlib display settings. No seaborn, no weird problems. Unfortunately sometimes I was running the cell that imported seaborn and sometimes I wasn't. Oh dear.
